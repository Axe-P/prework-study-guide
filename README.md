# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework study guide was very useful in determining my understanding when it comes to programming.
I find coding/programming very satisfying, it is nice to be able to "build" something and understand how it functions.
I have learned that this is do-able yet going to take some time to learn.
This webpage is an coalescence of my coding knowledge.
